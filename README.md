# Recreating Octopath Traveler's UI
This was a project I started with the primary goal of learning about UI/UX through recreation. Octopath Traveler is one of my favorite games, so I wanted to see how well I could recreate some UI elements from the game, and in the process, perhaps learn why certain decisions were made.
